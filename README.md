# Why this repository exists

I’m building a home development laboratory.

>The goal is to have a set of always-on services (databases, observability, blob storage, messaging, etc.) so I can prototype new ideas fast — without setting everything up locally every time or spinning up cloud resources just to test an MVP.\
\
Think of it as my “production-minded playground”: a reusable foundation for experiments that can later move to the cloud with minimal changes.

I wanted a place where:
- I can spin up services quickly
- I can experiment safely
- I can break things without consequences
- and, most importantly, **learn how systems behave when they’re closer to production reality**

This repo is that place.

## How this repo should be read

This is not a polished framework.\
It’s not a copy-paste solution.\
And it’s definitely not finished.

It’s a living repository, evolving alongside what I’m building and learning.\
Expect iterations, refactors, and occasional breaking changes — all part of the process.

If you’re building your own development homelab, or trying to bridge the gap between local development and production systems, you’ll probably recognize many of the problems solved here.
